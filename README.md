 Strongly Typed Language
C# is a strongly typed language

Every variable must have a defined data type

This helps in reducing errors and makes programs more reliable

 # Type Casting
Type casting is required when converting one data type to another

Implicit casting happens automatically (small → big)

Explicit casting is required for big → small conversions

 # Operators and it's types
Operators are used for:

Calculations

Comparisons

Logical conditions

Examples include arithmetic, relational, logical, and assignment operators 
# DataTypes
types 
and code with example

# Clean and Readable Code
Writing clean and readable code is very important

Proper naming, indentation, and formatting improve understanding

Clean code is easier to debug and maintain
